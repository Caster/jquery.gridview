===============

A plugin for the jQuery javascript library that provides an easy and very flexible way to present data on a webpage.

About
-----

Provide a completely different way of navigating through several menu options or pages - at least, that's one possible usage. Be creative, think of a good place to use this plugin :)

By default, this plugin shows data in the form of `div` elements in a parent `div` as a grid of the children in their parent. This grid can be zoomed with the mousewheel (see the [credits](#credits)) and, if the draggable plugin from jQueryUI is installed, dragged with the mouse. _Everything_, however, can be customized easily with the options, that are documented on [1].

-   jQueryUI ([link](http://jqueryui.com/))
-   MouseWheel plugin by Brandon Aaron ([link](http://brandonaaron.net))
